Import project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install STM32CubeIDE
Open the program 
File->Import 
Select Import ac6 System Workbench for STM32 Projects
Built the project by selecting Project->Build All
In the folder Release you can find file E45_BMC_FW_LL.elf which is used for programming BMC MCU.

Pre-build and Post-build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon the need there are additional scripts under "scripts" folder that can include information about the build (tag and hash). 
This information can be later used by requesting it from Raspberry side over the UART.


Flashing the BMC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BMC can be programmed with ST-LINK programmed ( Either a development board or dedicated programmer). It is recommended while programming BMC to take out the Raspberry, as the programming of BMC will cause RPI to restart hardway several times. 
The programming is done over STM32CubeProgrammer. Start the program, import the previously generated programming file (e.g. E45_BMC_FW_LL.elf), press Connect. 
Press Download image.
